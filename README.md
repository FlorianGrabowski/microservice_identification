# Identification of microservices using semantic search and transformer architectures
This is the repository containing the practical work conducted during the preparation of the master thesis "Identification of microservices using semantic search and transformer architectures". This repository serves the purpose of the publication of the practical work. The project was initially developed on a different repository because I worked with proprietary company data. All the data in this repository except [graph_model.py, graph_util.py] is open source and can be used according to [license](/LICENSE).
## Acknowledgments
The thesis was prepared for the "Master Software Technology” – Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree from the [University of Applied Sciences Stuttgart DE](https://www.hft-stuttgart.de/), in cooperation with the company [Exxeta AG](https://exxeta.com/). A special thanks again here to my supervisors Prof. Dr. Jörg Homberger, Bernd Malek, and Dominik Neumann.

- the toolkit [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), according to GPU & CUDA version of choice, or without CUDA (slow)
## Future Updates
This repository will not be modified until the end of the evaluation process.

However, afterwards it is possible, that I will make additions or changes to the project. In the form of further development or simply cleaning up the project structure.
